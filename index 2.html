    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I'm not joking, i called him Boris. But yeah, anyway, I'm Adam, I don't really do much anymore. But I'm obsessed with tech and video games, Zelda and COD is my main. I have a 7.3kd in Warzone, thats my only flex. Haha, but nah I have a nearly 2 year old daughter and shes honestly my life, the whole reason I want to do this is to get to a better point in life so I can support her.
