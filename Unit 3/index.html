        I am highly enthusiastic and passionate about technology. Since my early school years I have always had a higly driven personality when it comes to anything involving tech. While I lack prior education I know this has <b>no</b> downfall on my ability to perform in the field of technology.
        <br/><br/>
        In my previous work I worked as part of a company servicing servers and the physical backend of many companies so I have a strong understanding of the physical aspect of technology.
        Due to my role in retail and hospitality in previous jobs I feel like I have the necessary people skills required to excel in any enviroment.
